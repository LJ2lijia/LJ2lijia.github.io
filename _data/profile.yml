    I am the Assistant Professor of <a href="https://collegeai.tsinghua.edu.cn/">College of AI</a> at <a href="https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/">Tsinghua University</a>. I obtained my PhD degree from <a href="https://www.pku.edu.cn/">Peking University</a> in 2025, supervised by Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=ZC7SObAAAAAJ&hl">Zhi Jin</a> and Prof. <a href="https://ligechina.github.io/">Ge Li</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    My research direction is Programming Language Processing (PLP), which aims to develop artificial intelligence techniques for understanding and generating source code. Specifically, my research interests include:
    <ul>
      <li>Foundation models for PLP. We develop new foundation models (such as model architectures, training strategies, inference strategies, and evaluation metrics) for improving the capabilities of models in code understanding and code generation.</li>
      <li>Applications of PLP. We explore the intersection of PLP and other disciplines. For example, we apply PLP to improve the efficiency of software development, such as code generation, test generation, and code optimization. We are also interested in the application of PLP in embodied AI and neuroscience.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    I am looking for <b>highly-motivated interns</b> to join my research group. Feel free to email me with your resume attached. 长期招收线上/线下科研实习生，可提供工位、定期一对一讨论，欢迎优秀本科生和研究生联系我，请附带上简历。
